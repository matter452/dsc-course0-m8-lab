# Aviation Accident Analysis
This analysis evaluates aviation accident severity from 1983 onward, focusing on professionally built aircraft that may still be active. Two core metrics drive the assessment: aircraft destruction rate and the serious/fatal injury fraction (the share of passengers seriously or fatally injured given an accident). Aircraft are segmented into small and large categories to ensure meaningful comparisons, with the goal of identifying makes and models that demonstrate stronger structural resilience and passenger survivability.

Early patterns show a clear distinction between small and large aircraft. Large aircraft generally exhibit lower serious/fatal injury fractions and more consistent survivability outcomes, while small aircraft show greater variability and a higher likelihood of meaningful passenger injury in accidents. Beyond aircraft design, weather—particularly IMC—and certain phases of flight, such as climb and maneuvering, emerge as strong severity drivers. These operational and environmental factors materially influence both destruction and injury outcomes and are critical to understanding overall risk.

### SMALL AIRCRAFT MAKES:
***Grumman*** has the highest destruction rate among the top 10 small aircraft makes with the lowest destruction rate.
It also does not make the top 10 lowest serious injury/fatality rate. This means while it barely makes it into the a low destruction rate category it also is a more frequently dangerous aircraft for passenger in the event of an incident.  

While generally a higher destruction rate indicates more severe injuries and lethal outcomes for passengers in the event of a crash, Cessna goes against this. While it is 12th lowest destruction rate of the top 15 lowest makes it also is one of the safer makes in the event of a crash. On average it has less lethal/serious outcomes for passengers.

That being said, small aircraft typically have comparable lethal/serious outcomes for passengers. Largely most small air craft makes have a high liklelyhood of as much as a 25% chance of severe/to lethal injuries

### ***LARGE AIRCRAFT MAKES***

Large aircraft tend to have fewer incidents than small aircraft. However, when there are incidents/accidents they have a slightlhy higher on average destruction rate than small aircraft. Regardless of destruction rate large aircraft have a much lower rate of fatalties and severe injuries. Boeing and Airbus however, has the highest occurences of severe and lethal injuries for passengers. However, the majority of their accidents resulted in serious injury and fatalty rates about or below 10%. 

Large aircraft are by and large much safer than small aircraft in the event of a crash or incident

For large airplanes most accidents do not result in serious/fatal injuries. Serious and fatal injuries do happen but, they are much more rare. Boeings typically are very safe with their models being in the 8 to 13% range of severe/fatal injuries

for small airplanes they are much more likely to have incidents that result in serious/fatal injuries. Compared to large aircrafts they have a higher variability in crashes resulting in severe/fatal injuries. They more frequently have an an severe/fatal injury rate that is not zero.

### WEATHER'S EFFECT
IMC - Pilots need to operate the aircraft by instrument only due to poor visual conditions from weather
VMC - Pilots operate the aircraft from visuals outside of the cockpit; weather is good with good visibility
UNK - Unknown

Incidents with poor weather had a significant destruction rate over 35%. Conversely incidents with good weather had a much lower destruction rate, below 10%. Of those incidents with poor weather they had an average serious injury/fatality rate of near 70%

### Phase of flight effect
Two stand out phases have a high impact on destruction and sersious/fatal injury, Maneuvering and Climb. Both phases have around 30% destruction rates, and both have about 35% serious/fatal injury rates.
